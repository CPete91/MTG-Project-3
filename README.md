# Magic: The Gathering Deck Builder

## Intro

_Magic: The Gathering_ was released by Wizards of the Coast in 1993 and is one of most popular trading card games on the market with over 20 million active players as of 2015. Between the years of 2008 and 2016 alone an estimated 20 billion _Magic_ cards were printed for the game.

As a team, we saw the great potential to make a companion app to help players digitally construct decks without spending any money to do so. In addition, we wanted to be able to give users feedback on their deck construction and ways to optimize their game play. Marrying those two ideas we created our _MTG Companion App_ (known on our team as _Dirty Magic_).

## Future Development

- Add more active game play mechanics, a dice roller, coin flip, life tracker, etc.

- A purchase/purchased option which allows users to list all cards they currently own and construct decks out of that. In addition, the ability to search for a card and purchase it directly from the search result.

- A deck win/loss counter so users can track how successful a given deck they have constructed it.

- Social aspect where users can vote and comment on constructed decks. Then the ability to search and sort all user created decks based on likes.
